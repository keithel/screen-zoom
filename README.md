# ScreenZoom

ScreenZoom is a small Qt application that illustrates how to grab screen areas under a cursor and display them zoomed.

## Detail

This illustrates how to grab screen areas under a cursor, no matter which display your cursor may be on in a multi-monitor configuration.
This was tested with Qt 5.15.2, however it should work with Qt 5.10 or above, or Qt 6.

## Build

You can build one of two ways:
* Right in Qt Creator by loading the qmake .pro file
* From a command shell by invoking qmake and make.
